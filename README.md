# LearnAI-Mask-Detection-Project

“The goal of this computer vision AI project is to develop a model that can accurately detect the presence of masks in real-world images and video streams. The model will be trained on a dataset of labeled images of individuals wearing and not wearing masks as well as individuals not wearing masks properly, and will be evaluated on its ability to correctly identify mask usage in un-encountered images. The end result will be a tool that can assist in enforcing mask usage in public spaces and potentially aid in the fight against the spread of COVID-19.”
